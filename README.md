# 8ball

A tiny command-line tool that answers your life questions.

## Getting Started

You can get the tool up-and-running by compiling it using CMake:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
Then compile the project based on your OS (e.g. on Linux you'd use `make`).
Now you should be able to run the command-line tool as follows:
```sh
./8ball "<your question here>"
```

Have fun and don't forget; don't drink the blue liquid ;)
